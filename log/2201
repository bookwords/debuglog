1. Android app crash while calling JNI function.
   The app runs fine while commenting the JNI function, and crashes while calling the JNI.
   Java team members update the android Studio SDK. Finally we found that the 'STORAGE permission' default 'disabled' after the app install.
   Dynamically request Android permission:   Android M introduces new run-time permission model which allows you to do this.
   高版本的android安装的时候不开存储权限，都是运行时询问，要用户同意才行 

2. MT7915 5G/2.4G AP supports MCS settings:
   iw wlan1 set bitrates vht-mcs-5 1:4
   But those AP cant use 'set tidconf' to limit the associated 'stations' MCS settings.
   and pay attention to the 'iw phy0 info' command, it lists the commands the target silicon supported.
   for example:
   '
   upported commands:
                 * new_interface
                 * set_interface
                 * new_key
                 * start_ap
   '
   and the files involved: 
   linux kernel:
   a. mt7915/main.c
      struct ieee80211_ops mt7915_ops
      -->set_tid_config, function not supported.
   b. mac80211.h
      struct ieee80211_ops{
      void (*tx)(struct ieee80211_hw *hw,
            .
            .
    int (*set_tid_config)(struct ieee80211_hw *hw,
            . 
            .
   b. net/mac80211/cfg.c
      struct cfg80211_ops mac80211_config_ops

3. Android App http test got completely different results, Note10 ran 4 times while 180 times for Mate40, and the 'connect time' is almost equal.
   Finally found the root cause is the log defination is 'DEBUG' rather 'NOTICE', you know old Huawei mobile phones have 'storage issues', the log took too much time.
