Description: this error message encountered while debug APP upgrade with USB storage disk.

Introduction: 
APP will detect insertion of USB disk, automatically mount the disk, parse disk files and find the APP's newer verison. 
And then upgrade operation will be executed, and then generate the restart script and quit with 'exit'. 
The restart script do the copy and paste job and then start the new one. this is the place while the error message up occured.
After several times search in google, they all say the root cause is the hugepage memory.

Solution:
I'm stuck here for several days. 
And finally, it came to me that the restart script still got the environment to the old APP. 
and I tried to move the resart script to the main app rather than the child process, only the flag(a temp file in /dev/shm) was set in child process.
And it succeeded.

Nice work for me.

2. 230512, packets loss in DPDK throughput test.
Working on DPDK project several days ago, and I got a packets loss in a test whih two linux hosts. It's weird that the TX rate not so high, only about 200Mbps.

I was nervous that some bug fix  I commited may led to this. 

But finally, It'ss the software bridge(linux host we used as a bridge to damage the packet) to blame.
